This is a refactored version of the classic Connect 4 game, written in Python using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. The project includes both a command-line interface and a graphical interface built with Pygame.

Purpose
The aim of this project was to:

Refactor an existing Connect 4 game into a modular and maintainable codebase

Demonstrate the practical application of the MVC design pattern

Improve the structure, readability, and testability of the code

This project is part of my personal software portfolio and demonstrates core development skills in Python.

This project uses the MVC architecture:

Model: Manages game state and rules

View: Handles output (either console or graphical)

Controller: Manages user input and game logic flow
